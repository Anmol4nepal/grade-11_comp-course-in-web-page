PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS AND LOGIC </header>

    <h1>Programming Concepts</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Programming Language</h2>
    <p>Programming languages are formal languages comprising a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output. They are used to implement algorithms and create software. Languages can be categorized into low-level (close to machine code, like Assembly) and high-level (closer to human language, like Python).</p>

    <h2>Low-level, High-level, 4GL Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Low-level Languages:</strong> These are closer to machine language and include Assembly language. They offer more control over hardware but are harder to write and maintain.<br>
        <strong>High-level Languages:</strong> These are more abstract and easier to use. Examples include Python, Java, and C. They are designed to be easy to read and write.<br>
        <strong>Fourth-generation Languages (4GL):</strong> These are designed to be even more user-friendly and are often used for database management and report generation. Examples include SQL.
    </p>

    <h2>Compiler, Interpreter, and Assembler</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Compiler:</strong> Converts the entire source code into machine code before execution.<br>
        <strong>Interpreter:</strong> Executes instructions directly without previously converting them to machine code.<br>
        <strong>Assembler:</strong> Converts assembly language code into machine code.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax, Semantic, and Runtime Errors</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> Mistakes in the code that violate the rules of the programming language.<br>
        <strong>Semantic Errors:</strong> Errors in logic that cause the program to operate incorrectly.<br>
        <strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> Errors that occur during the execution of the program, often due to invalid operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Program Design Tools â€“ Algorithm, Flowchart, and Pseudocode</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Algorithm:</strong> A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.<br>
        <strong>Flowchart:</strong> A graphical representation of an algorithm.<br>
        <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> A high-level description of the program's logic using natural language.
    </p>

    <h2>Control Structures: Sequence, Selection, and Iteration</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Sequence:</strong> Execution of statements in a linear order.<br>
        <strong>Selection:</strong> Decision-making structures like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>switch</code>.<br>
        <strong>Iteration:</strong> Looping structures like <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do-while</code>.
    </p>

    <h1>C Programming Language</h1>

    <h2>Introduction and Features of C Language</h2>
    <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language known for its efficiency and control. It is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, and embedded systems.</p>

    <h2>Structure of C Program</h2>
    <p>A typical C program includes preprocessor directives, global declarations, the <code>main()</code> function, and other user-defined functions.</p>

    <h2>C Pre-processor and Header Files</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Pre-processor Directives:</strong> Commands processed before the actual compilation, like <code>#include</code> and <code>#define</code>.<br>
        <strong>Header Files:</strong> Files containing C declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.
    </p>

    <h2>Character Set used in C</h2>
    <p>The C character set includes alphabets, digits, special symbols, and whitespace characters.</p>

    <h2>Use of Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are non-executable lines used to document code. In C, single-line comments start with <code>//</code> and multi-line comments are enclosed in <code>/* ... */</code>.</p>

    <h2>Basic Data Types in C</h2>
    <p>Basic data types include <code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double</code>.</p>

    <h2>Constants and Variables</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Constants:</strong> Fixed values that do not change during execution.<br>
        <strong>Variables:</strong> Named storage locations whose values can change.
    </p>

    <h2>Operators and Expressions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Operators:</strong> Symbols that perform operations on operands, like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>.<br>
        <strong>Expressions:</strong> Combinations of variables, constants, and operators.
    </p>

    <h2>Input/Output (I/O) Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions like <code>scanf()</code> and <code>printf()</code> are used for input and output operations.</p>

    <h2>Selection Control Statement: Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>if:</strong> Executes a block of code if a condition is true.<br>
        <strong>if-else:</strong> Executes one block if the condition is true, another if false.<br>
        <strong>switch:</strong> Allows multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.
    </p>

    <h2>Iteration Control Statement: Looping</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>while:</strong> Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.<br>
        <strong>do-while:</strong> Similar to <code>while</code>, but the block is executed at least once.<br>
        <strong>for:</strong> Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
    </p>

    <h2>Array: Definition, Types (1D and 2D), Matrix Addition and Subtraction</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Array:</strong> A collection of elements of the same type.<br>
        <strong>1D Array:</strong> A linear array.<br>
        <strong>2D Array:</strong> A matrix with rows and columns.<br>
        <strong>Matrix Operations:</strong> Addition and subtraction of matrices.
    </p>

    <h2>String: Definition and String Functions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>String:</strong> A sequence of characters.<br>
        <strong>String Functions:</strong> Functions like <code>strlen()</code>, <code>strcat()</code>, <code>strcmp()</code>, <code>strrev()</code>, <code>strcpy()</code>, <code>strlwr()</code>, and <code>strupr()</code> for manipulating strings.

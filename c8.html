    <h1>Digital Society and Cybersecurity Overview</h1>

    <h2>1. Digital Society and Computer Ethics</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Digital Society</strong> refers to a society heavily influenced by digital technologies and the internet. It encompasses how digital tools impact communication, work, education, and social interactions.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>2. Concept of Information Security</h2>
    <p>
        Information security is about protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Key principles include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Concept of Cybercrime</h2>
    <p>
        Cybercrime refers to criminal activities carried out using computers or the internet. Common types include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hacking</strong>: Unauthorized access to computer systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: Stealing personal information to commit fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Tricking individuals into providing sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyberterrorism</strong>: Using the internet to conduct terrorist activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Malicious Software and Spam</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Malicious Software (Malware)</strong>: Software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device or network. Types include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Viruses</strong>: Programs that replicate themselves and spread to other computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Worms</strong>: Similar to viruses but can spread without human intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Trojans</strong>: Malware disguised as legitimate software.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware</strong>: Locks users out of their systems or data until a ransom is paid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Spam</strong>: Unsolicited messages, often sent in bulk, which can be a nuisance and a security risk. Spam can spread malware or phishing links.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Protection from Cybercrime</h2>
    <p>
        This involves measures to safeguard against cyber threats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Passwords</strong>: Using complex and unique passwords for different accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Updates</strong>: Keeping software and systems updated to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Antivirus Programs</strong>: Using antivirus software to detect and remove malware.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness</strong>: Educating users about phishing and other social engineering attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Digital Signature</h2>
    <p>
        A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. It ensures that the content has not been altered and verifies the sender's identity. Digital signatures are widely used in secure communications and electronic transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Concept of Cyber Law in Nepal</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber law in Nepal encompasses the legal issues related to the use of the internet and digital technologies. This includes laws on cybercrime, data protection, and electronic transactions. The legal framework aims to address issues like hacking, data breaches, and online fraud, and to promote a secure digital environment.

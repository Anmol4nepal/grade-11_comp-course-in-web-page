<h1>Introduction to Computers</h1>
    <p>Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user.
    <h1>Some Characteristics/Features of Computer</h1>
    <p>
        The implementation of computers is not only limited/confined to a small area, rather they are used from simple domestic tasks to complex scientific research and engineering. The use of computers is increasing day by day due to some special features or characteristics that computers possess. Several features of computers are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Computers are the accurate machines, meaning the results produced by computers are 100% accurate. Since they follow GIGO, the error that may arise in output is due to human error, not the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Computers work at tremendously high speed. The operating speed of computers is measured in milliseconds, microseconds, picoseconds, and nanoseconds, which means computers can perform millions and billions of instructions per second.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Storage is the area or unit capable of storing data and information for present and future use. Storing data allows users to retrieve it whenever required. Today, computers come with high volumes of memory measured in Megabytes (1024 KB), Gigabytes (1024 MB), Terabytes (1024 GB), and Petabytes (1024 TB).</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Computers are generally designed to serve more than one type of work. The implementation of computers is not only limited to specific purposes; they solve general user requirements and can be used in more than one type of job.</li>
        <li><strong>Diligence:</strong> The feature of computers in which they don't get tired even after working for long periods. Computers can perform any number of tasks continuously until accomplished. Once the instruction is given, the computer follows the command until it is terminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> A computer is an automatic machine. Once the instruction is generated, it performs accordingly until the command is terminated. We don't have to issue continuous commands to operate the computer. This is called automation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Applications/Implementations/Uses of Computer</h1>
    <p>

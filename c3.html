COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM </header>

 <h1>Concept of Software</h1>
    <h2> Definition of Software</h2>
    <p>Software refers to a collection of programs and data that tell the computer how to operate. Unlike hardware, software is intangible and provides instructions for the system to execute various tasks.</p>
    
    <h2> Categories of Software</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Includes operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and utility programs that help manage computer hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed for end users, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.</li>
        <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Tools that optimize system performance, such as antivirus programs, disk cleaners, and backup utilities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1> Concept of Operating System</h1>
    <h2> Introduction to Operating System</h2>
    <p>The OS acts as a bridge between users and hardware. It controls essential functions like memory management, process scheduling, and file handling.</p>
    
    <h2> Role of Operating System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Manages CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Handles multiple running applications (multitasking).</li>
        <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Provides interaction methods like Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI).</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Access Control:</strong> Protects data through authentication and encryption.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Functions of an Operating System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Allocates memory to running applications.</li>
        <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> Organizes and manages stored files and directories.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Controls input/output devices like printers, keyboards, and USB drives.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Detects and responds to system failures.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Windows Operating System</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to GUI-based OS and its Features</h2>
    <p>Windows provides a <strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong> with icons, windows, and menus for easy navigation.</p>
    
    <h2> Managing Files and Folders with File Explorer</h2>
    <p><strong>File Explorer</strong> helps users organize, search, and manage files.</p>
    
    <h1>Open Source and Mobile Operating Systems</h1>
    <h2> Concept of Open Source OS</h2>
    <p>Open-source operating systems like <strong>Linux</strong> allow developers to modify and distribute the software freely.</p>
    
    <h2> Introduction to UNIX, Linux</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UNIX:</strong> A powerful, multi-user OS used in servers and workstations.</li>
        <li><strong>Linux:</strong> A UNIX-based OS available in different distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Concept of Mobile Operating System</h2>
    <p>Mobile OS powers smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices. Examples: <strong>Android (Google), iOS (Apple), Windows Mobile</strong>.</p>
